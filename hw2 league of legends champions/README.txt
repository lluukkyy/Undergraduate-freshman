DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC: 
Please be clear & concise!  What is your hypothesis for the creation
of this statistic?


	custom() collects data and divide them into 10 ranks in terms of value.
	for example: 100,95,82,80,75,1. These six values will give out the result of:
	Rank 1 :2 100, 95
	Rank 2 :1 82
	Rank 3 :1 80,75
	Rank 4 Nothing in this rank
	Rank 5 Nothing in this rank
	.
	.
	Rank 10:1
	
	and then prints out the average of these data and top 10 data.


RESULTS FROM 3RD STATISTIC:
Paste in a small amount of sample output into this file, or list the
file names of sample input & output included with your submisssion.
Describe what is interesting about your statistic on this data.
