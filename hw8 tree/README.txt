TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

i tried to put keys in random order, 
which created several isomer trees from a same library of keys.
i've tested some extremely large-degree-trees,for example the max degree of n.
With n*(n+1)/2 keys put in, the program functioned well.



MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
(optional, please be concise!)
greetings!
i submitted my first version of program which got 6 points in test 4,5,6, 
at Wednesday night.
i thought it was in time yet a little bit late, about one minute:
"submission timestamp: 04/06/2017 12:01:48 AM" .
i know it's cruel but please,
could you have some flexibility with that? Thanks a lot!
:)
